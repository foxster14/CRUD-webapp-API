# PHP Data Driven Web Application
This simple web application utilizes PHP and a MySQL database to pass data from the frontend to the backend. The database is comprised of a template database that the mariaDB distribution of MySQL provides called "Employees." This application has full create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) functionality. This application also uses a simple API that I created using Python and JSON.
